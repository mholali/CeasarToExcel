# CeasarToExcel
My personal project:
Converts data from Ceasar Pipe Stress software's Excel output to useable Excel data for Structural analyses 

Data output in Excel from a Ceasar Pipe Stress software comes out with the presentation a little bit spread and not pretty. The load condition are spread along a lot of columns.
