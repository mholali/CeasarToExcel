# CeasarToExcel
My personal project:

Converts data from Ceasar Pipe Stress software's Excel output to useable Excel data for further Structural analyse.

Data output in Excel from a Ceasar Pipe Stress software comes out with the presentation a little bit spread and not pretty. The load conditions are spread along a lot of columns. StressLoads Rev1.xlsx shows that output file. Data is also given in another file (extraStressLoads Rev1.xlsx). The two xlsx files have non-similar columns.

The Python script CeasarToExcel.py combines both files and then outputs the data in a nice and assessible format.

My next personal challenge will be to convert this output into Structural Analysis software (SACS)'s use.
